# How to Fix Chrome Web Store Rejection

## Rejection Reason
**"The metadata provided is irrelevant to the observed functionality"**
Specifically: "media is irrelevant to the description"

## What This Means
Your screenshots/promotional images don't accurately show the features you describe in your store listing.

## Your Extension HAS These Features
✅ Enable Editing (Unlock Fields)
✅ Test Data (Auto Fill)
✅ Dev Mode
✅ Show/Hide Fields & Sections
✅ Schema Names with overlays
✅ Copy Record ID
✅ Web API Viewer
✅ Plugin Trace Logs
✅ JS Libraries viewer
✅ Option Sets viewer

## The Problem
Your current screenshots likely:
- Don't show these features in action
- Are generic/don't demonstrate actual functionality
- Show different features than described

## ACTION PLAN TO FIX

### Step 1: Create Proper Screenshots (REQUIRED)

You need **at least 3-5 screenshots** that show your extension actually working:

**Screenshot 1: Toolbar Overview**
- Load your extension in Chrome
- Navigate to a D365 Contact or Account form
- Take a screenshot showing the FULL toolbar with all buttons visible
- Highlight key sections with arrows/boxes

**Screenshot 2: Schema Names Feature**
- Click "Show Names" button in your toolbar
- Take screenshot showing schema name overlays on actual D365 fields
- This proves the feature works as described

**Screenshot 3: Dev Tools in Action**
- Show the "Enable Editing", "Test Data", or "Dev Mode" buttons
- Or show the result after clicking them
- This demonstrates your development features

**Screenshot 4: Web API or Trace Logs**
- Click "Web API" or "Trace Logs" button
- Take screenshot of the viewer that opens
- Shows your inspection capabilities

**Screenshot 5: Option Sets or JS Libraries**
- Click "Option Sets" or "JS Libraries"
- Show the modal/viewer that appears
- Demonstrates advanced features

**Screenshot Requirements:**
- Size: 1280x800px or 640x400px (exactly)
- Format: PNG or JPEG
- Must be actual screenshots of YOUR extension running
- Should clearly show D365 Helper toolbar and features

### Step 2: Update Store Listing Description (Optional but Recommended)

Use the simplified description from `STORE_LISTING_SIMPLIFIED.md` which:
- Accurately describes what your extension does
- Matches the features you can show in screenshots
- Removes any ambiguity

### Step 3: Create Small Promo Tile (REQUIRED)

**Size: 440x280px**

Simple design:
- Title: "D365 Helper"
- Subtitle: "Developer Toolkit"
- Background: Professional gradient or solid color
- Optional: Small icon/logo

Tools to create:
- Canva (easiest - use "Custom Size" 440x280)
- PowerPoint (create 440x280 slide, export as PNG)
- Any image editor

### Step 4: Resubmit to Chrome Web Store

1. Log into Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard
2. Go to your extension listing
3. **Update Screenshots**: Upload your new 3-5 screenshots
4. **Update Promo Tile**: Upload your 440x280 small tile
5. **Review Description**: Make sure it matches screenshots
6. Click "Submit for Review"
